      <p>The first week of Phase 0 is coming to a close and I think I am starting to become a little more comfortable with this HTML/CSS stuff we have been working on. At the very least I was able to get this blog post up so that's a plus.</p>

      <p>I just finished watching the fireside chat video with Shereef and am once again juggling a couple feelings that have come up while going through the application and prep process so far. First and foremost I am completely excited for what is to come. DBC is like nothing I have ever done in my life and I can not wait for October 27th to get here. The other common feeling that comes every time I really think hard about DBC is essentially fear. Don't take this the wrong way, I am 100% confident that I can get through the program and graduate on the other side. I have gone through 4 years of engineering school with relative ease and just generally believe I am up to any challenge. But the thought of working 15 hour days on something I am brand new to with other people who are far more experienced is pretty intimidating.</p>

      <p>Luckily during the chat Shereef addresses a lot of these fears and why it would be a lot more surprising if we didn't have them. He also goes into detail on the culture that is cultivated at DBC in order to help everyone succeed despite these trepidations. The idea that DBC is a non-competitive environment where everyone is encouraged to help one another is definitely encouraging. The real challenge for me will be in taking responsibility for my learning and really making this process worth while. I have never been one to willingly ask for help and to expose my ignorance to others. This is in direct contrast to the learning style that Shereef and DBC are trying to teach and I am exciting to be pushed to change my way of learning. I know that I will often be uncomfortable, stressed, and pushed to my limits and am legitimately excited to see how I handle these situations.</p>

      <p>I think I am guilty of being in a lot of the bad mindsets talked about in the video. Whether it be the entitled consumer he talks about in the restaurant or just thinking that finishing DBC alone will get me a job in web development. The more I learn about the program I realize that I am going to need to really focus on myself, and not allow myself to fall into this way of thinking. I need to constantly check in and ensure that I am pushing as hard as possible and getting everything I can out of this. As Shereef said these 9 weeks are mine and I plan to get everything I can out of them.</p>
