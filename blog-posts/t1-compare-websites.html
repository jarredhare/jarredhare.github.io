        <p>I have been tasked with comparing 3 of my favorite sites in what will be my first technical blog for Dev Bootcamp Phase 0. It wasn't very hard to choose the sites since I, along with millions of other people visit these pages daily. The ones I chose are <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN</a>, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a>.</p>
        <p>I chose these sites because I literally use them every single day and they provide information that I am interested in. Each of these websites in the most basic of terms are places to find and share news. However the content and format of each site is massively different than the others.<p>

        <p>Take reddit for example. It is easily one of the most popular and widely visited sites on the internet right now. Compared to something like ESPN the home page is relatively simple and straight forward. It is just a list of links submitted by any user that is ranked according to votes by other users. But after getting past this simplistic intro you have the oppurtunity to dive into any number of millions of topics in the various "subreddits." A user experience on reddit can range from reading a scientific paper on new engines being developed by NASA to seeing what can only be described as an image that will scar your mind for the rest of your life. While it may seem intuitive at first to navigate through the information the collection of data is so vast things can be impossible to find. The search function often provides no help whatsoever in finding things and posts you have already seem are sometimes lost to you forever. Someone can easily get lost on reddit for hours at a time and come out feeling enlightened, ashamed, exhausted, or proud. The beauty of this site is that anything and everything in the world is fair game and you can immediately find tons of other people who share the curiousity.</p>
        <p>Like I mentioned before the ESPN front page is considerably more complex than the one seen on reddit. It is filled with large images and videos. Thousands of links to other parts of the site and stories scatter the page and you are greeted with even more as you scroll down. As an everyday user I am accustomed to using the site and can navigate it easily but a quick test with my fiance shows that getting to the information that you are after is not obvious. Some people may find the homepage cluttered and can easily get lost down the many rabbit holes of information. I use this site regularly to check on sports results as well as extensively using their fantasy football application every season. Once you know how to get around it's fairly quick to get to what you want and an average session is only a few minutes once I have the information I was looking for. I believe they sell a VIP "insider" type subscription but I have never felt the urge to pay extra for whatever it entails.</p>

        <p>Engadget is essentially a very large and popular tech blog that covers pretty much anything in the world of science and technology. As a complete nerd I love the site and check it several times a day to stay up to date on anything new and interesting. The site itself strikes a balance between the simplistic design of something like reddit and the over the top one of ESPN. It is very easy to navigate and after a few featured images at the top is simply a rolling list of recent articles down the page. I think most people would enjoy the site and be able to locate the information they were after with relative ease.</p>

        <p>Those are just a few of the sites that I frequent every day and hopefully after a little more time in DBC I will be able to create something similar to them.</p>
