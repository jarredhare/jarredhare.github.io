        <h3>What is my Gregorc Thinking Style?</h3>
        <p>Back at the onset of DBC a few months ago we were asked to take a quiz to determine our thinking style and at that point and today mine has stayed the same. Both times I took the test
          I was firmly within the Abstract Sequential style and scored much lower within the others. Reading over the description of my learning style really drives the point home to me that this test is accurate. Here is an image showing a basic overview of the abstract sequential thinker's tendencies:</p>

          </div>
        <h3>My Biggest Struggle</h3>
          <p>I think my main take struggle here is that my thinking style is almost counter to the way Dev Bootcamp learning is structured. This is especially apparent in the part about how I do best when working alone. I have always felt this way and so even the few pairing sessions so far have been difficult. It's not that I don't see the value in working with others. I completely understand the advantage to the process but it is just my natural reaction to be adverse to it. I go into each pairing session nervous and stressed out for no reason considering they have all gone very well. I think being aware of my reactions and feelings toward this is a good first step to changing my thinking process and something I will work on at DBC.</p>
          <p>Another area it is spot on is the fact that I have a hard time with "sentimental thinking" and expressing emotions. In general I am a very reserved person and don't show much emotion to others around me. Writing constant reflections, blog posts, and even check ins with pairs right now seem forced and against my natural way of doing things. But like group work I can see the advantage and will continue to push myself and work out of my comfort zone.</p>
        <h3>Working Toward a Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>When I first read about the Emotional Intelligence based work at DBC one of the things that resonated with me the most was the material on a growth vs. fixed mindset. I realized that I had probably leaned toward a fixed mindset so far in my life and am actively working on changing that. Constantly checking in with myself to make sure I am moving toward a growth mindset is one of the ways that I hope to overcome the struggles caused by my thinking style at DBC.</p>
