        <p>This week my technical blog is on a topic entirely new to me before this week. I have never used JavaScript in the past and if asked I probably would have guessed it was used to make those old school Java games I played in elementary school. This would be entirely wrong especially since Java and JavaScript are two entirely different things that are only linked in name as a marketing ploy. But after some research I think I have a better handle on it.</p>
        <h3>Why is Javascript popular in Web Development?</h3>
        <p>The main reason that JavaScript became so popular for developers is that it came at the right time to take over an emerging market. It was the standard for Netscape Navigator in the 90's when that was THE browser and has maintained dominance across all current browser including Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc. JavaScript is a client side object oriented programming language meaning the code is interpreted in the browser on the users machine. This means that every browser is a Javascript interpreter and every device with a browser can run JS. Because of this JS is still the web standard 20 years later. On top of this a lot has been built around JavaScript including incredibly useful frameworks like jQuery and many others that make it far more useful. At one time it seemed likely that Javascript was dying off but it was pushed back into the mainstream by being used by Google in several of their applications.</p>
        <h3>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>As I said before the fact that the code is executed on the clients side is an advantage in that it saves resources on the server. On top of that JS is thought to be fairly easy to learn and has a massive open source community for developers to rely on. This has led to numerous frameworks and libraries being developed for JS for people to use. </p>
        <h3>What are its limitations?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Security issues exist since malicious code can be bundled in and run on the clients computer instantly.</li>
          <li>Because JS is run on the client side in the browser it can be rendered in different ways and cause issue.</li>
          <li>The syntax is very forgiving and will not throw errors when some "mistakes" are made making them harder to find.</li>
        </ul>
