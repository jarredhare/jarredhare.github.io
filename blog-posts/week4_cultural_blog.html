        <p>While the above video is pretty hilarious to watch, it also deals with a huge problem facing the tech world. Most people have heard the issue of net neutrality mentioned but unless they were
        particularly interested in finding out they may be unfamiliar with the details and why this matters.</p>

        <p>Net neutrality in a nutshell is the idea that there should be no discrimination online between websites. Whether you are pulling up a sweet gif of a cat diving into a mirror, checking your Facebook, or watching Breaking Bad on Netflix shouldn't matter in terms of how quickly you can access the data. This is the basic premise of an open and free internet and it is in huge jeapordy right now. On May 15th, 2014 the FCC voted to allow ISP's like Verizon and Comcast to move forward with plans for paid internet "fast lanes." Essentially companies like Netflix would have to pay these ISP's (and in some cases already do) in order for their customers to have the best connection to their content.</p>

        <p>While this money gouging is bad enough, it gets worse when you consider what it could do to startup companies. Where every dollar is crucial in the success and failure of a new tech company, it will likely be impossible for these small businesses to come up with the funds needed to access the fast lanes. This will have a massive effect on how competitive these companies can be when facing off with established corporations with seemingly limitless funding.</p>

        <p>Thankfully this is not set in stone yet. The FCC has been taking comments from the public over the past few months and hearing what the people have to say. Hopefully they will reconsider what they are doing and keep the internet free and open to everyone. I recommend watching the video and looking into how net neutrality law changes will affect you.</p>
