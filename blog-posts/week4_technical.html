      <div id="blog">
        <p>Looking over the possible topics for these weeks blog I noticed there were like 5 or 6 topics and I was really familiar with nearly all of them. However the group_by method I had literally never seen before so clearly it is the perfect thing for me to publicly share my knowledge on! Just let me consult ruby-doc and irb for a few minutes and get back to you...</p>

        <p>OK, so that wasn't so hard. It looked a little weird at first in the documentation but pretty much everything does until I try it out a few times in irb. Since this blog is meant for someone with relatively little experience with Ruby, I will walk through my own thought process in learning to use this method. First off, here's the description courtesy of ruby-doc.org:</p>

        <div id="image">
          <img src="../imgs/group_desc.png" />
        </div>

        <p>So for me, it is not at all obvious what that means. There are parts that make sense and others that are a little tougher to reason out. I mean clearly it is a method that is used on a "collection" which is already kind of vague. What qualifies as a collection? Hash/Array/Range or maybe all three, so that is something we need to look into. Then it says it groups this collection by the result of a code "block" and returns a Hash of keys and values. The keys and values are defined above but it will be a lot easier to explain with some example code.</p>

        <p>The basic example that I found on multiple sites is this:</p>
        <div id="image">
          <img src="../imgs/group_by.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Seems a little odd at first but it's really not bad once you walk through it. The group_by method takes the range from 1-6 and for each of those values applies the code block on the right. The block is between the curly brackets {}. In this case the block is taking the modulo or remainder of dividing each number by 3 and then grouping things with the same result. So in this example 4 % 3 is equal to 1 and 1 % 3 is also equal to 1. So 1 and 4 are the values associated with the key 1. It does the same for all other members of the range 1-6. It groups these in the output hash which comes after the # which is a comment in this example. </p>

        <p>The last thing is that this method does work on various data structures. In irb I tested it with hashes, arrays, and just simple ranges like the example we used and they all work. It gets a little complicated with hashes but it's all the same basic principle.</p>
