      <h3>Pairing</h3>
      <p>To be completely honest I was really hesitant when I first learned that DBC focused really heavily on pair programming. In college I was part of a lot of groups where I ended up doing the entire
      thing and since then generally prefer to work alone. But the first half of Phase 0 is starting to change my mind. My pair sessions have been amazing so far and I feel like I learn so much in each one. While at this point it is usually faster to complete a problem by myself, a great pair can get me to think differently and solve problems in a way I never would have considered.</p>

      <p>A paticularly great pairing session happened this week. The person I was working with clearly did not have as good a grasp on Ruby as me so I went ahead and took the lead in how to get through the challenge. Halfway through our pseudocode where I was talking out a fairly complicated way to get to a solution, my pair made a suggestion the he didn't know how to implement in code but set us on a much better path for the entire problem. This is the great benefit of pairing to me. We can use eachothers strength's and ideas to collectively reach better products in the end. Where at first I was nervous going into a pair session now I am generally excited over what I will be able to learn.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Giving and receiving feedback turns out to be a huge part of the phase 0 experience at DBC. Providing feedback for pairs, reading GPS feedback, and rating the feedback others have given is a standard part of my day to day activities now. While it can seem a little tedious at times I can really see the benefits. There are times that I don't feel comfortable saying something during a pair session that I can leave as feedback once I have thought it over. I tend to spend a good amount of time considering what I am going to say and focusing on giving actionable, specific, and always kind feedback to my cohort mates. So far from the reviews my feedback has received I think I am doing a pretty good job and I hope that it is helping the people who read it to get better.</p>

      <p>Now on to receiving feedback myself. I have thought a lot about this because I was honestly a bit surprised with my reaction to the feedback so far. I'd say like 90% of the time I receive really good feedback about how great of a job I am doing and I appreciate it a lot. The other 10% I get perfectly helpful suggestions given by my pairs who sincerely want me to get better. I don't know why but I still don't take it very well at all. I can logically understand that they are just trying to help but I will think about this "negative" feedback for days just wondering why they would say such a thing about me. I'm not sure exactly where these feelings come from but I was thinking that it may be something to do with the lack of formal grading at DBC. Being good in school was always a way to measure myself and know that I was succeeding. Since DBC has a different approach our feedback is pretty much the closest thing to this that exists. The good news is that I am getting a lot better at it. The more feedback I get the more normal it is to read through and realy try to take the suggestions to heart.</p>

      <p>Overall the pairing and feedback system is great and part of the overall experience that I wanted at DBC. There are countless software bootcamps these days and I chose DBC because of the emotional intelligence aspects of the curriculum that sets it apart. This is not simply a way to learn programming but also a path to a better mindset for me.</p>
