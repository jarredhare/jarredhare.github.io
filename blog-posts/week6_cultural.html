      <div id="blog">
        <p>This week's cultural blog post is on the issue of stereotype threat and more specifically how it has affected me throughout my life. I watched a academic talk given by Claude Steele explaining the idea and how effects it can have on an individual that identifies as a part of a social group. The basic idea seems to be that when faced with frustration in performing something that you care about, some people will perform more poorly due to fear of confirming a negative stereotype about a group that they belong to.</p>

        <p>I thought for some time about if I have ever experienced something like this and I couldn't really come up with anything. Any time that I think about my performance being measured academically, physically, or in the workplace the frustration that I face is always centered on myself. I worry how this will refelect on me as an individual and don't really fear that this could confirm some stereotype about a group that I belong to. This probably has several causes foremost of which is that I don't really believe that I belong to any groups with strong negative stereotypes. I am a white male in his mid twenties without any strong religious affiliation working in the STEM field. None of those social identities inherently have negative stereotypes as far as I am concerned. On top of that my personal belief is that anything is open to me and the only thing holding me back would be my own effort so any frustration I feel would be directed at myself.</p>

        <p>I can however imagine lots of people where this is a reasonable concern. An easy example to discuss would be women working alongside me in the STEM field. After reading several other DBC students' personal blog posts one of the main issues facing the tech industry is the large disparity between the genders. I can see how when faced with frustration it would be possible for a woman to fear that perhaps she was confirming a stereotype where women perform worse in these areas or don't belong there. As seen in the video and personal experience I think a great way to help them would be to simply say that their performance has nothing to do with any social identity they may possess. They are the only ones responsible for their performance and if I have learned anything so far in DBC it is that.</p>
