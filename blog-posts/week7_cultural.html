      <div id="blog">
        <p>After reading through the enormous list of values presented by DBC the ones that resonated the most with me in terms of the time I have been the happiest were Adventure
          and Nature. Growing up in Oregon these values were instilled into me at an early age and are a huge part of who I am. This past year my fiance and I went around the world
          and my favorite place was the coast and countryside of Ireland. Hiking around and exploring the outdoors there was better than our visits to Paris, Shanghai, or any
          other major city.</p>
        <p>I like to think that I get a 5 out of 5 for living up to both of these values. I quit my job to travel the world for a year on the adventure of a lifetime and will
         continue that with the adventure of DBC. I appreciate nature everywhere I go from camping to hiking to just getting outside and enjoying it.</p>
        <p>I probably get asked for advice on traveling once a week since we got back a few months ago so obviously it relates directly to my values. My general advice is to
          see the world while you have the oppurtunity to and of course a lot of my recommendations are for the more nature oriented places. Ireland, the Turkish desert of
          Cappadocia, or a riverboat ride down the Mekong river in Laos are all at the top of my list.</p>
        <p>Like I went over last week, stereotype threat is not really something that I notice or am ever worried about. I suppose that in cases where I were to be subject to it
          considering my values could be a good way to alleviate that frustration and fear. Thinking about my values leads me to a felling of contentment knowing that
          whatever is currently frustrating me is only a temporary setback and I will get through it. Overcoming obstacles is an adventure in itself and I look forward to the
          one to come at DBC.</p>
