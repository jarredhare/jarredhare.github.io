        <h3>Issues with SQL</h3>
          <p>One of the biggest issues with SQL is a cyber attack known as SQL injection. Most web applications these days work with databases containing
            massive amounts of user/customer data. This can range from you basic name and address all the way up to your social security or bank account
            numbers. Generally you imput this data into some pretty standard input boxes to insert items or gain access to the database. The issue is that
            in those same input boxes clever hackers can insert SQL code to retrieve this information without needing a password. While there are many
            different ways this can be done I will only go through a very simple case.</p>

          <p>The following line of code is designed to take a username and pull up the data related to that user:</p>
          <pre><code>statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ='" + userName + "';"</code></pre>
          <p>Now instead of putting in a valid username, imagine the hacker inserted something like this:</p>
          <pre><code>' or '1'='1 #===>username</code></pre>
          <p>This would lead to the SQL being evaluated in the following way and since '1' = '1' is always going to be true this is a valid statement that
            would return the <em>entire</em> user database.</p>
          <pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1';</code></pre>
          <p>This is clearly a pretty huge security risk especially for databases containing sensitive personal information but there are ways to mitigate it.
            This is all new to me so I will try to summarize a few of the simpler countermeasures that new developers can use.
            <ul>
              <li>Prepared Statements or Stored Procedures: Instead of simply blindly passing whatever input someone has typed into directly into your SQL, this method stores the
                input as a variable and passes it in later in the code. This ensures that a hacker can't change the intent of the code with the code he inserted.</li>
              <li>Escaping: A less secure method is to escape the user input so the special characters that they type in their code are escaped and interpreted simply as text.This
                is obviously a huge simplification and I would recommend anyone using SQL to research much further if they plan on keeping their database secure.</li>
            </ul>
