          <li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
            <p>I am really not a person who deals with conflict a lot in my life. I like to think that I am really easy to get along with so it just isn't something that happens often. So this story I am going to tell will sound pretty stupid to like 98% of people who read it, but in my life this was a legitimate conflict. Most people have hear of the online video game World of Warcraft. Both my roommate and I played a ton of it in college. I'm talking like 4+ hours every single night playing online with a bunch of people from accross the country. Well basically one night our 25 man group had only one open spot. I was invited to go play and my roommate was left out. His response to this was to literally log into the router settings and disable my internet so he could play instead. You can tell how little conflict I have had to endure in my life by this next statement. I was probably as mad as I have ever been in my laugh. I realize that is pretty laughable, it's a game, but still, at the time I was pissed.</p>
          <li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
            <p>There was no like deep rooted source to this conflict. We generally got along well in the past and still do to this day. It was just a one time thing.</p>
          <li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
            <p>So my roommates strategy for resolving the conflict was to just avoid me entirely. He had his own room in the house and he stayed in there the vast majority of the time. My initial reaction was that I wanted to hit him. I mean I really wanted to. To the point where I was considering how much trouble I would get in if I walked up there. Luckily I was able to convince myself that was a bad decision and chose instead to ignore him right back. After a few days this got pretty old since we lived and worked together, so I reached out with a text telling him the whole thing was stupid and we should move past it. He apologized and we moved on.</p>
          <li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
            <p>My actions definitely made the conflict better eventually. By reaching out to him and talking about the issue we were able to diffuse the situation and move past it. I could have easily went on ignoring him and letting the situation fester and get worse.</p>
          <li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
            <p>Probably the only thing I would change is talking to him about it right away. There was no need for us to be mad at eachother for several days.</p>
          <li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
            <p>I learned the best way to deal with an issue like this between two friends is to just talk it out and move on. Ignoring the issue is not helping anyone out.</p>
