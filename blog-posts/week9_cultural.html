        <p>Before I jump into the actual topic of this weeks blog, I just want to start off with how crazy it is that DBC is only like 3 days away. At the beginning phase 0 seemed like this long journey and it could not have gone by faster. I loved every minute of it from the challenges to the GPS sessions and highly recommend it to anyone who is considering trying it out.</p>
        <p>So for our final week of phase 0 we have been asked to analyze the questions we have asked to our Google+ community. This is made up mostly of other students in Phase 0 as well as a couple of moderators. I went through my history and other than like 20 requests for pair sessions I only asked a question the very first week. The question was really just a clarification request for the challenge and it was promptly answered by a moderator from DBC. So clearly the main take away from looking at myself...I don't ask enough questions. There were plenty of times where I was frustrated or stumped and asking someone for help probably would have been the best course of action. But generally my approach is to look up things online or just keep working at them till I can figure them out. I think it will come much more naturally to ask questions once I am on site at DBC with everyone else.</p>
        <p>But since I am not a good example I went ahead and read through some of the other posts on the group page. There were some common traits that really made the best questions that led to a lot of discussion and solutions to students problems.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They are specific as to what the problem is.</li>
            <li>Provide examples in the form of a link to code/screenshot/etc.</li>
            <li>Explain how to replicate the issue.</li>
            <li>Respond to the feedback and questions when people comment on your problem.</li>
            <li>Explain what the have already done to troubleshoot the issue.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I think that crafting questions that follow these guidelines leads to the best possible results. Time is not wasted on solutions you have already tried and people can quickly grasp exactly what the issue is you are facing. Hopefully when I am stuck in the future I can follow my own advice and ask questions like these.</p>
