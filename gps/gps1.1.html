        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Pairing with my partner worked out great. We worked together well and each took turns driving and navigating. We both contributed ideas and helped eachother out. I look forward to pair programming more. I felt like our technical skill levels were a bit different but we helped eachother and it went great.
